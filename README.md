Project Overview:
Our project is Spotify, where we have realised 6 patterns: adapter, singleton, strategy, fabric, observer, decorator. 
Idea is to recreate the most known music platform and show hot it works through desing patterns.
Purpose to remake main function using each pattern in every event.

Main body: 
Adapter - provide user ability to choise not only by id and by name too.
Singleton - prevent recreation cli(main class in our project)
Strategy - The outprints of commands of user choise
Fabric - Create new items, songs, and e.t.c
Observer - Notify subscriber about new updates
Decorator - add new output depending on if user subscribed either not

Conclusion:
To sum up, We can say that one of difficulties was to create an idea of the project where we can use all 6 patterns, and then the second problem was how to connect each pattern with each other so it could work without any problems and conflicts. In future we could make out programm more responsible, add more function, and work on that how they execute, to make it more pleasure for eyes and easy to understand.
